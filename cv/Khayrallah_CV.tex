\begin{packed_itemize}
\item Improving methods for low-resource \& domain adapted machine translation:

\item Developed Simulated Multiple Reference Training (SMRT), a novel MT training method that improves translation performance by approximating the full space of possible translations for each training example using a paraphraser \citep{khayrallah-etal-2020-simulated}.
\item Conducted analysis on training machine translation on noisy text \citep{Khayrallah+Koehn2018WNMT} and co-organized a shared task on parallel corpus filtering \citep{Koehn+2018WMT}.
\item Lead participant in yearly DARPA LORELEI low resource MT evaluation (2016-2018). % where I  build MT systems to translate languages such as Uyghur, Tigrinya, Oromo, Sinhala and Kinyarwanda into English in very low resource settings with stark domain shifts (using religious text to translate social media).

== About {{<a name="about"></a>}}
I am a senior researcher at Microsoft, working on the Microsoft Translator team. \n\n
Previously, I was  a PhD student in [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/ Computer Science] at The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), advised by [http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/ Philipp Koehn]. I was part of the [http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)] and the [http://www.statmt.org/jhu/ machine translation group].  #I work on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically machine translation (MT). I am particularly interested in the challenges arising from low resource and domain adaptation situations. 

In Summer 2019, I was a research intern at [https://lilt.com Lilt], working on translator-in-the-loop machine translation. 

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science in May 2015. I worked with [http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~lewis  Colleen Lewis] on [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493415 computer science education], [http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stolcke/ Andreas Stolcke] on tools for speech processing, and [http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~feldman/ Jerry Feldman] on [https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/ai/naturallanguage15.pdf natural language understanding].


Below are highlights about me; you may also be interested in my full [Khayrallah_CV.pdf CV]. You can also find my work on [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=muJh2XQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao Google Scholar].

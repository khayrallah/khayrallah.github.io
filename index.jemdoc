== About {{<a name="about"></a>}}
I am a senior applied scientist at Amazon, working on the [https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/ AGI team]. 

Previously, I was a senior researcher at Microsoft, working on the Microsoft Translator team. Before that, I was PhD student in [https://www.cs.jhu.edu/ Computer Science] at The Johns Hopkins University (JHU), advised by Philipp Koehn. I was part of the [http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)] and the [http://www.statmt.org/jhu/ machine translation group].  #I work on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifically machine translation (MT). I am particularly interested in the challenges arising from low resource and domain adaptation situations. 

In summer 2019, I was a research intern at [https://lilt.com Lilt], working on translator-in-the-loop machine translation. 

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science in May 2015. I worked with [http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~lewis  Colleen Lewis] on [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493415 computer science education], [http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~stolcke/ Andreas Stolcke] on tools for speech processing, and [http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~feldman/ Jerry Feldman] on [https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/ai/naturallanguage15.pdf natural language understanding].
